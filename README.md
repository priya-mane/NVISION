Network Visualization Interventions Supporting Interpretation of Objective News

### Advisors:

* Daniel Benjamin, Information Sciences Institute
* Fred Morstatter, Information Sciences Institute

### Goals:

Present network representations as an intervention to aid interpretation of bias in sharing networks
1. Emerging Topic Modeling

    * Identify popular topics before they are polarized
    * Once polarized, group identity impedes the effects of interventions


2. Network Visualizations

    * Visualize information sharing networks for public consumption
    * Compare visualizations to determine which is more intuitive
